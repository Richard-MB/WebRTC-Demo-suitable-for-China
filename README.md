#WebRTC Demo suitable for China

##Introduction

It will help you build your first WebRTC app in China.
This project just implement some basic functions, as for some more senior features they are waiting for you to explore.

##Why I set up this repository

I've been working on webrtc for more than a month. I build some demos with some different implementations, such as 
[GAE](https://appengine.google.com/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).During that,
I have encountered many problems when I trying to build my webrtc demo in China, so I decided to set up a step-by-step
demo for developers in China, which aims at help people getstarted with webrtc. 

Here, I strongly recommend you that you should really read over the article 
[Getting started with WebRTC](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics) on HTML5 Rocks.
It is the best article I've seen that introduce WebRTC. Believe me, if you are familiar with that, you have understood 
most of the WebRTC.

##Requisites:

#Basic Knowledge:
  
1.Nodejs
2.Javascript and Html/CSS
3.Socket.io
  
If you are a novice to one of them, I suggest that you should read one or two passeges which introduce it to new hands.

#Installed on your development machine:

1.Google Chrome
2.Code Editor
3.Git
4.Web cam and web audio
5.Node.js

*I assumed that you are using Windows.
*It also works in an android device.

Thanks to Sam Duton, Adam Ullman, they give me many help when I was studying WebRTC.
